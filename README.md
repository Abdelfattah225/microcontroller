# Project microcontroller(Atmega 328p) with keypad and LCD 
my team and I would like to share our project with you

 Briefly:

 In the beginning, we started to do simulation through the Proteus program, and we needed the code that we would burn on the atmega 328p. We started writing and testing codes until we reached the code that would run the circuit with us. We worked on the PCB layout. We tried this format in order to reach the least number of errors, thank God.  We got 2 errors .
 After that, we had the most important part, which is how to burn the code on the atmega. We had two solutions
  The first is that we use USB, and the last is that we use the Arduino, so we decided to use the Arduino board to burn the code with it. We had problems with the Arduino in how to deal with it, but thank God we were able to quickly understand how to solve it by learning how to work on the program, especially since it was the first time we worked on it  .
 We started to do a test on the atmega through small circuits or even from the Arduino IDE program . 
We did the project on a test board to make sure that everything is perfect before we jump it on the PCB.
